# Covid-19-app

In this project I used a carousel, button input with a click, scroll bar for info, and created active hyperlinks on helpful facts.  You can also click the link to find and make an appointment for a vaccine near you.

The beginning of my approach was to find a working API I can pull related to health.

After some time, I landed on covid-19 cases.

I wire-framed to build on how I wanted to structure the website itself.

After deciding on how I wanted to move forward I started with the HTML aspect, then javascript, and css for last.

If I could redo I would like to add modal to my project but I just don't know where I would use it at the moment.
